## A guide for accomadating minors at a Hackathon

There are a lot of amazing Hackathons at the moment, but very few of them seem to be accomodating to under 18s. Having been the youth organiser at [HackTheMidlands](http://hackthemidlands.co.uk/) for 2 years now it often confuses me as to why this is. After asking other organisers, it seems to be down to worries about responsiblity, extra effort and not being sure what to do. So for those seeking it, I've written a guide to help you get going!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/meowterspace/Child-Protection/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
